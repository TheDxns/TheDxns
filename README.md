<h1>Hi, Iâ€™m @TheDxns ðŸ‘‹</h1>
<h2>I'm currently working as an IT Support Specialist at a large Automotive company. <br />
While studying on the Opole University of Technology I have developed a passion towards software development. <br />
There I've learned the basics of programming and software engineering and since then I'm expaning my knowledge by self-learning. <br />
For my current company I'm creating and maintaining software solutions in web technologies, Java and Spring Boot. <br />
I have created a internal home page, content display solution and online forms which are used as an overlay for a Service Desk. <br />
<br />
<h2>Iâ€™m interested in backend technologies - especially development of web services and I'm a big fan of <a href="https://spring.io/projects">Spring Projects</a> :leaves:<br />
Right now I'm working on a <a href="https://github.com/TheDxns/blog">blog</a> project which is using Vue.js and Vuetify for the frontend and Spring Boot on the server side (with Keycloak as an authorization server).
